# Expo Linking API: Inconsistent Deep Link Handling

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Linking` API where `Linking.getInitialURL()` returns `null` or fails to resolve the URL, causing inconsistent deep link handling.  The issue is not always reproducible, making debugging challenging.  The provided solution offers a more robust approach to handling deep links in Expo.

## Bug Description

The Expo `Linking` API is crucial for handling deep links, but in some situations, `Linking.getInitialURL()` fails to return the expected URL, often returning `null`. This leads to unexpected behavior in the app, especially when relying on the initial URL for data loading or navigation.  Inconsistency in behavior across different devices or Expo versions exacerbates this problem.

## Solution

The solution incorporates several improvements to ensure the deep link is handled reliably. The implementation includes error handling, improved asynchronous operations, and multiple attempts to retrieve the URL using a combination of async/await and `setTimeout` for better handling of delays in initial URL resolution.  This makes the deep link processing more robust and resistant to inconsistencies.
